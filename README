= intro =
This module contains experimental code that extends gstreamer. The library will
never be ABI stable. if you are interested in any code here, please help to
mature it in order to get it into upstream.
The extensions are quite likely to be required to build a SVN version of
buzztrax.

You can install this module locally too.
Use following option for ./autogen.sh or ./configure
  --prefix=$HOME/buzztrax
When installing the package to e.g. $HOME/buzztrax remember to set these
environment options:
libraries:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/buzztrax/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
devhelp:
  export DEVHELP_SEARCH_PATH="$DEVHELP_SEARCH_PATH:$HOME/buzztrax/share/gtk-doc/html"
pkg-config:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$HOME/buzztrax/lib/pkgconfig"

  export GST_PLUGIN_PATH="$HOME/buzztrax/lib/gstreamer-0.10"
