= tempo =
a) should we rename 'tempo' to 'tempo_sync' or 'song_tempo'?
b) can we remove the iface and use TAGS?
  - we already have GST_TAG_BEATS_PER_MINUTE
    gst_tag_register (GST_TAG_BEATS_PER_MINUTE, GST_TAG_FLAG_META, G_TYPE_DOUBLE,
      _("beats per minute"), _("number of beats per minute in audio"), NULL);
  - we need GST_TAG_TICKS_PER_BEAT and GST_TAG_SUBTICKS_PER_TICK
    where to register them?
  - the main problem with tags instead of an iface is that it is not easy to
    change it while playing, we'd need to use the playback rate
c) can we use events?
   - the application would push them on to the sink and they travel up to the
     sources

= GstBtChildBin =
- would be useful for the GstIirEqualizerNBands (num-bands->children)


= GstSimsyn =
- have more variants in the same plugin (share code, like oszillators and filter)
  - we'd like to have one with
    - dual-osc
    - two ADSR envelopes
    - each envelope can modulate volume and filter-cutoff/resonance
  - current simsyn is missing key-tracking for the filter

= FrozenTrackPlayer (MemoryAudioSource) =
- when playing pre-recorded tracks, one would trigger them at the start with the
  root note
- one problem here is that we can't start playback in the middle of the song or
  loop parts
- we want a special machine that only has a wave-table parameter and plays the
  sample.
  - we should re-work memory audio source for it
  - it can be a local machine (not installed as a separate plugin), but we'd
    need to move it into bt-core (so that it works outside of the ui too)
  - machine.c currently checks for "host-callbacks" property and uses that to
    pass the BuzzCallbacks. The element can use them to access the wavetable.

= synth components =
The libgstbuzztard already has components, such as the envelope and tone-
conversion helpers. It would be nice to extend on this. Ideally simsyn would be
a composite object of:
* oscillator
* filter
* envelope
